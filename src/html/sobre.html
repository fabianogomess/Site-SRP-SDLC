<h2>
    Software Requirement Patterns and the Software 
    Development Life Cycle
</h2>

<p>
    Most software projects extrapolate budget and delivery 
    times due to improper practices related to requirements 
    gathering and specification, resulting in incorrect, 
    omitted, misinterpreted, or conflicting requirements. 
    Requirements reuse has been a feasible alternative to 
    mitigate those issues, assisting requirements engineers 
    to produce better quality specifications. A fairly 
    discussed reuse approach is the software requirement 
    pattern (SRP) concept. An SRP is an abstraction that 
    aggregates behaviors and services found in multiple 
    applications, and that can be reused in similar software 
    applications. Despite being widely debated, SRP is still 
    poorly used in practice to produce better quality 
    specifications. Recently, I have been investigating 
    the reasons RPs are still in their early stages in the 
    software industry. In this context, the main goal of this 
    research project is to extend the benefits of requirement 
    patterns (e.g., development time savings and better 
    quality specifications) to other stages of the software 
    development life cycle, beyond requirements engineering. 
    Regarding the evaluation of this proposal, different 
    application domains with tool support should be 
    considered for the generalization of our results.
